  <h1>The (No Longer) Filthy Bachelor</h1>
  <h3>Pursuing a Life Approaching Functional Adulthood</h3>
  <div>Hi, my name is Scott, and I just turned 30. On the one hand, this was a totally arbitrary milestone. Physically, financially, emotionally - nothing in my life changed between the last day of my twenties and hte advent of this new, terrifying decade. But socially, 30 is an age fraught with significance. Depending on who you ask by this age I should have:
<ul id="adult-list">
  <li>A steady career and some degree of financial stability</li>
  <li>A romantic life that, if not already including a serious relationship, marriage or children, is at least heading in that direction.</li>
  <li>Thoughtful opinions on serious adult topics like property tax and gas mileage.</li>
  <li>And for that matter, a car or house, or at least an apartment rented from someone the average person wouldn't describe as "slum lord".</li>
 </ul>
    So while nothing material has changed, by merit of surviving long enough to start a third decade my filthy bachelor habits are no longer endearing. They're signs of childish dysfunction. So while I'm in no rush to chase after the above hallmarks of "adulthood", I did find myself pondering a question: what if I start acting my age?

    <h3>The Issue At Hand</h3>
    <p>The filthy bachelor is a well-established archetype in contemporary America. Familiar cliches include: neck-based facial hair, refrigerators filled with take-out and empty mustard bottles, shower curtains hosting self-contained eco-systems.</p>
    <p>At the same time that "grownup" America mocks these stereotypes, however, the average age of first marriage is getting higher and higher. We are rapidly becoming a nation of bachelors, so to me the question is: how do the unattached, unsupervised single men of America move into their 30s gracefully?</p>
